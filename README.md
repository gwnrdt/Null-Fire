## History
At first there was no such thing as `NullFire` - there was `FireDoors`.
Yeah, it was a small `Doors` script before.

After `lolhax` leaked `infinite crucifix` method it gave me a huge headstart.

Big thanks to `@bryld`, he very helped me developing my `Doors` script and learned me alot of exploiting stuff.
I would never forget him and never stop thanking him.

I worked very hard on it and made a script of size about `3000`-`4000` lines of code!
Then I realised that I want `FireDoors` to support more than 1 game, so I renamed it to `FireHub`.


...


After a while I got sick of `Doors` and rarely joined that game (btw, same happened with `Pressure`, but about that later).

`Doors` script was __discontinued__.

After a break that lasted about `2 years` I started developing `FireHub` again.
I made a known script called `FireHub - Pressure`.
Then I made a `Funky Friday` one and `Natural Disaster Survival`.

After collabing with `@seikoso`'s `NullHub`, `FireHub` turned into a `NullFire` (btw, I like that name).

I updated `Pressure` script really lot, so there was no other scripts that could do better than me.
And because of that I also got sick of `Pressure` (+ got __banned__).

At this moment (__8th of may 2025__) `NullFire` - `Pressure` is about to be discontinued, but I think I will still do some updates, just not that fast.

A bit later the game called `Dead Rails` became ultra popular.
I decided to make a script for it.

`NullFire` for `Dead Rails` became EVEN MORE POPULAR THAN `PRESSURE` (__#2 popular `Dead Rails` script on `ScriptBlox`__; __23rd of april 2025__).
I'm really proud of it.

## DEVELOPERS ZONE

NullFire is mostly open source project, so I even made documentations!
You can use any of NullFire's libraries or copy it's / their code, I don't mind.
You can read about libraries [here](https://github.com/InfernusScripts/Null-Fire/blob/main/Documentations/README.md), I'm trying to update these right after releasing updates for them.
